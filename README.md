qt-ubuntu-components
====================

This repository contains a modified version of the Ubuntu Phone OS sdk source available on 
[LaunchPad](https://launchpad.net/~ui-toolkit/+archive/ppa/+packages) modified to build properly on 
other platforms that Ubuntu, by removing hard-coded paths, etc.

Compilation instructions are given on the [Wiki page](https://github.com/LeoTestard/qt-ubuntu-components/wiki).
It's only available in french for now, but I will try to translate it soon.
